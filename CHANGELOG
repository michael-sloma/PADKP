1.1.0
*   Added an additional UI pane that shows raid dumps. DKP can be awarded for
    these dumps by the "award dkp" button as usual, or by right click->award
    dkp.

*   Added a "Quick Award DKP" option that creates a Time award for the standard
    DKP amount using the selected file.

*   Users can now preregister bids by sending a tell like "!preregister Cloak of
    Flames 50". They are then locked into that bid for the duration of the auction.
    This allows users to bid in auctions that they are managing.

*   Added a menu bar.

*   API tokens and log files locations will now persist from session to session.

1.0.0
*   We now integrate with the DKP site at padkp.net. Users can charge DKP for
    items and award DKP for dumps directly from the desktop app.

0.0.7
*   Copy grats message should now work as expected when multiple rows are
    selected
*   Bid cutoff where mains automatically beat alts increased to 10 for Velious.

0.0.6
*   Added keyboard shortcuts for most operations

*   Added a command to copy a text dump from only the selected rows

0.0.5
*   Added a right-click context menu with two options: "copy grats message" and
    "copy text dump".

*   Copy text dump produces a report of all concluded auctions, suitable for
    copying to discord or elsewhere.

*   Copy grats message produces a message suitable for copying into the game.

*   Added a new in-game command to override the "award loot" decision. See the
    Readme for details.

0.0.4
*   Fixed a bug that broke tied auctions.

0.0.3
*	The parser will correctly interpret bid messages like 'Cloak of Flames
	50dkp'. The additional 'dkp' will no longer cause the bid to be skipped

*	Added handling for alt/box bids. An alt bid is specified like this:
	'/t Lyfeless Cloak of Flames 50 alt' or '/t Lyfeless Cloak of Flames 50 box'
	Alts will only win auctions if there is no non-alt bid of 5dkp or greater.

0.0.2
*   Internal refactoring to separate the bidding rule logic from the GUI. This
    makes it feasible to write more complex rules.

*   The parser is now more robust. In particular, we can gracefully handle extra
    whitespace anywhere in a command.

*   Users can append comments to commands with a double pipe: ||. A command with
    a comment looks like this:
    /rs !BIDS OPEN Cloak of Flames || remember /tell quaff itemlink bid ONLY
    Comments are solely for humans to read, the parser ignores them completely

*   You can cancel your own auctions with the command !CANCEL itemlink

*   Open auctions expire after 30 minutes

*   Ties should be correctly reported. A tied auction remains open until closed
    or cancelled

*   We can now handle auctions of multiple identical items. A multi-item auction
    is started like this:
    /rs !BIDS OPEN !3 Cloak of Flames || WOW THREE!! Top three bids win.
    This will also work:
    /rs !BIDS OPEN Cloak of Flames !3 || THERE ARE THREE
    All the winners will be shown in the user interface.

*   Added an "auction details" button to display more details of the auction.

*   Added cleanup logic to the "Load log file" button. Repeatedly using the
    button to load different files will not longer eat up system resources.


0.0.1
*   Initial playtest!
