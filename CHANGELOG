0.0.2
*   Internal refactoring to separate the bidding rule logic from the GUI. This
    makes it feasible to write more complex rules.

*   The parser is now more robust. In particular, we can gracefully handle extra
    whitespace anywhere in a command.

*   Users can append comments to commands with a double pipe: ||. A command with
    a comment looks like this:
    /rs !BIDS OPEN Cloak of Flames || remember /tell quaff itemlink bid ONLY
    Comments are solely for humans to read, the parser ignores them completely

*   You can cancel your own auctions with the command !CANCEL itemlink

*   Open auctions expire after 30 minutes

*   Ties should be correctly reported. A tied auction remains open until closed
    or cancelled

*   We can now handle auctions of multiple identical items. A multi-item auction
    is started like this:
    /rs !BIDS OPEN !3 Cloak of Flames || WOW THREE!! Top three bids win.
    This will also work:
    /rs !BIDS OPEN Cloak of Flames !3 || THERE ARE THREE
    All the winners will be shown in the user interface.

*   Added an "auction details" button to display more details of the auction.

*   Added cleanup logic to the "Load log file" button. Repeatedly using the
    button to load different files will not longer eat up system resources.
