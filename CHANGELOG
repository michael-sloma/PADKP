0.0.7
*   Copy grats message should not work as expected when multiple rows are
    selected

0.0.6
*   Added keyboard shortcuts for most operations

*   Added a command to copy a text dump from only the selected rows

0.0.5
*   Added a right-click context menu with two options: "copy grats message" and
    "copy text dump".

*   Copy text dump produces a report of all concluded auctions, suitable for
    copying to discord or elsewhere.

*   Copy grats message produces a message suitable for copying into the game.

*   Added a new in-game command to override the "award loot" decision. See the
    Readme for details.

0.0.4
*   Fixed a bug that broke tied auctions.

0.0.3
*	The parser will correctly interpret bid messages like 'Cloak of Flames
	50dkp'. The additional 'dkp' will no longer cause the bid to be skipped

*	Added handling for alt/box bids. An alt bid is specified like this:
	'/t Lyfeless Cloak of Flames 50 alt' or '/t Lyfeless Cloak of Flames 50 box'
	Alts will only win auctions if there is no non-alt bid of 5dkp or greater.

0.0.2
*   Internal refactoring to separate the bidding rule logic from the GUI. This
    makes it feasible to write more complex rules.

*   The parser is now more robust. In particular, we can gracefully handle extra
    whitespace anywhere in a command.

*   Users can append comments to commands with a double pipe: ||. A command with
    a comment looks like this:
    /rs !BIDS OPEN Cloak of Flames || remember /tell quaff itemlink bid ONLY
    Comments are solely for humans to read, the parser ignores them completely

*   You can cancel your own auctions with the command !CANCEL itemlink

*   Open auctions expire after 30 minutes

*   Ties should be correctly reported. A tied auction remains open until closed
    or cancelled

*   We can now handle auctions of multiple identical items. A multi-item auction
    is started like this:
    /rs !BIDS OPEN !3 Cloak of Flames || WOW THREE!! Top three bids win.
    This will also work:
    /rs !BIDS OPEN Cloak of Flames !3 || THERE ARE THREE
    All the winners will be shown in the user interface.

*   Added an "auction details" button to display more details of the auction.

*   Added cleanup logic to the "Load log file" button. Repeatedly using the
    button to load different files will not longer eat up system resources.


0.0.1
*   Initial playtest!
